            <h2>Eat Well, Train Well</h2>
            <p>For effective gym performance and overall fitness, focus on a balanced diet that supports your workouts. Start your day with a nutrient-dense meal that includes complex carbs sustained energy and lean protein for muscle repair. If youâ€™re heading to the gym, eat a light snack 30-60 minutes before to fuel your workout without feeling too full. Post-workout, prioritize protein and carbs to help muscle recovery and replenish glycogen stores. Stay hydrated throughout the day, as even slight dehydration can impact your performance. Lastly, listen to your body and adjust your meal sizes and timing based on how you feel during workouts.

            <h2>Discipline is Key</h2>
            <p>To build discipline in fitness, start by setting clear, achievable goals and creating a consistent workout routine, as this helps form strong habits. Tracking progress and staying accountable with a friend or community can boost motivation. Incorporate habit stacking by pairing new fitness activities with existing daily tasks. Focus on consistency rather than perfection, and embrace small wins to build momentum. Address mental barriers by identifying common challenges and finding personal reasons ("why") behind your fitness journey. Lastly, reward yourself for milestones to reinforce positive behavior, making discipline a sustainable part of your lifestyle.

    <div id="popup-chest">
        <div class="chest-content">
            <p>The pectoral muscles, primarily the pectoralis major and minor, are responsible for shoulder flexion, rotation, and the movement of the arms across the body. Strong chest muscles enhance upper body strength, improve posture, and play a critical role in pushing movements. Exercises like bench presses, push-ups, and chest flies effectively target these muscles.</p>
            <p>The exercises for this day are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bench Press: 3 Sets 6-8 reps</li>
                <li>Incline Dumbell Press: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>
                <li>Upper Chest Bench Machine: 4 sets 6-8 reps</li>
                <li>Straight Chest Bench Machine: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>
                <li>Fly Machine: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>

    <div id="popup-back">
        <div class="back-content">
            <p>The back consists of several major muscle groups, including the latissimus dorsi (lats), trapezius, rhomboids, and erector spinae. These muscles support posture, stability, and many pulling movements. A strong back contributes to overall body strength, reduces injury risk, and aids in activities that involve lifting and carrying. Key exercises include pull-ups, rows, and deadlifts.</p>
            <p>The exercises for this day are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lateral Pulldowns: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>
                <li>Reverse Lateral Pulldown: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>
                <li>Wide Grip Seated Rows: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>
                <li>Reverse Wide Grip Seated Rows: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>
                <li>Close Grip Seated Rows: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>

        <div class="shoulders-content">
            <p>The shoulders are made up of the deltoid muscles, divided into the anterior, medial, and posterior deltoids, along with the rotator cuff muscles. These muscles allow a wide range of motion and are essential for lifting, pushing, and overhead activities. Strong shoulders provide stability and prevent injuries during upper body exercises. Overhead presses, lateral raises, and face pulls are excellent for shoulder development.</p>
            <p>The exercises for this day are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shoulder Press: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>
                <li>Lateral Raises: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>
                <li>Front Raises: 4 Sets 6-8 reps/li>
                <li>tCable Face Pulls: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>

        <div class="legs-content">
            <p>The legs include several powerful muscles: the quadriceps (front of the thigh), hamstrings (back of the thigh), glutes (buttocks), and calves. These muscles are fundamental for movements like walking, running, jumping, and lifting. Strengthening leg muscles not only enhances lower body power but also improves balance and functional mobility. Squats, lunges, and deadlifts are staple exercises for leg strength and endurance.</p>
            <p>The exercises for this day are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Barbell Squats: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>
                <li>Leg Press Machine: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>

            <p>Located in the upper arm, the biceps (front) and triceps (back) work together to allow arm flexion and extension. Biceps are heavily engaged in pulling motions, while triceps are essential for pushing actions. Strong arms support a wide range of upper body movements and enhance overall strength. Common exercises include bicep curls, tricep dips, and extensions.</p>
            <p>The exercises for this day are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Barbell Curls: 4 Sets 6-8 reps</li>
